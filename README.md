# Predicting the English Premier League (EPL) Match Winner
# Description

This project is a part of the Master's Program in Applied Mathematics and Data Science, focusing on predicting the winner of English Premier League (EPL) matches using machine learning, specifically a Random Forest approach.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from a dual passion for football, particularly the EPL, and the desire to apply technical skills in a domain of personal significance. The unpredictability of EPL matches and the potential to contribute valuable insights for betting enthusiasts and Fantasy Premier League managers drove the project's inception.

# Problem and Objective

The English Premier League is known for its dynamic and competitive nature, making match outcome prediction challenging. The project aims to utilize machine learning, specifically the Random Forest model, to analyze historical match data and predict the team likely to win a given match.
